"*Rule number one about the multiverse: nobody understands the multiverse. If anyone ever tries to tell you how it really works, they're lying. Either they're lying to you, or they're lying to themselves.*" -Unknown

There are currently two competing theories to explain the multiverse:

Realism and Infinitism.

## Realism
Realism states that Material Reality is the only valid universe, and the Breach is but a dimension existing underneath our own. Under this model, the various realms of the Dreamscape need not be explained, as they are but simulations being run on advanced computation systems and do not truly exist.

## Infinitism
Infinitism states that all realms are tiny bubbles of reality floating in the infinite expanse of the Breach. Sometimes, these realms may touch, intersect, or even contain other realms. Under this model, all realms are equally real and valid.

# The Breach
[Cosmology🌌TheBreach](Cosmology🌌TheBreach.md)

The **Breach** is an **interstitial realm**, a chaotic expanse that exists between stable realms, functioning as both a barrier and a bridge across the multiverse. Far from being empty, the Breach is filled with **wild nanotechnology**, **unpredictable energies**, and often **eldritch abominations**, all coexisting in an ever-shifting, hazardous environment. One of its most feared phenomena is **Breachfire**, a destructive force that disassembles matter at the atomic level. Travel through the Breach is essential for navigating between realms, but it is incredibly perilous without advanced technologies like **Vargas Fields**, which protect vessels and their occupants. Exposure to the Breach’s chaotic elements can lead to insanity, destruction, or the release of catastrophic anomalies into stable realms. Despite its dangers, the Breach remains the only known avenue for multiversal exploration and connectivity.

# Types of Realms in the Multiverse

In the multiverse, realms vary widely in structure, scope, and properties, falling into several broad classifications. While some adhere to familiar physical laws, others display unusual or arcane characteristics, and a few defy standard classification entirely. Understanding these differences allows for better navigation, resource management, and operational planning within ORDER.

#### Infinite Material Realms

These realms resemble **Material Reality** (Mater_ia) in both structure and physics. They are characterized by their vastness, containing multiple galaxies, countless stars, and potentially infinite worlds. These realms operate under **standard physical laws**, making them familiar to those from Mater_ia, though their size and complexity often make them functionally unknowable in their entirety.

- **Key Characteristics**: Multigalactic, infinite in scale, governed by familiar physics.
- **Examples**: Material Reality itself serves as the archetype for this category.


#### Single System, Heliocentric Realms

These realms consist of a single, self-contained **solar system**, typically featuring one central star, several planets, moons, and other celestial bodies. A finite boundary—often appearing as a star-filled dome—encloses the realm, isolating it from the rest of the multiverse. These are among the most common realms encountered.

- **Key Characteristics**: Single solar system, central star, finite and enclosed by a boundary.


#### Single World, Geocentric Realms

These realms are limited to a single **planet**, often with an atmosphere and environment resembling traditional habitable worlds. The world may be orbited by a single moon or a sun-like entity that provides light and heat, but these celestial elements are not part of a larger cosmic system. Like heliocentric realms, geocentric realms are enclosed by a finite boundary.

- **Key Characteristics**: One central planet, geocentric structure, finite boundary.


#### Netherrealms

Netherrealms are distinct in their **subterranean or enclosed structure**, existing almost entirely as networks of tunnels, caverns, halls, or liminal spaces. These realms lack traditional skies and are shrouded in darkness or dim lighting, creating a labyrinthine and often dangerous environment. Netherrealms frequently connect to other realms through natural or artificial pathways, forming an alternative to direct Breach travel.

- **Key Characteristics**: Underground, enclosed, no sky, extensive inter-realm connectivity.


#### Anomalous Realms

Anomalous Realms defy simple categorization, featuring **unusual and often surreal structures**. These realms may contain floating islands, atmospheric anomalies, or other configurations that challenge known physics and logic. Their unique properties often make them areas of intrigue and high value for research and exploration.

- **Key Characteristics**: Defy traditional structures, often surreal or otherworldly in nature.

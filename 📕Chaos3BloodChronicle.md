I am dead. I blew up a knock-off Death Star while I was still inside. I am dead. So why am I still here? I think, therefore I am. I live.

I awake in a Xaran med bay. They pulled me out of the wreckage a week or so after the mission. My allies seem surprised to see me. Awestruck, even, that I'm not a smear of stardust in the void.

Anyway, we won the war while I was busy "respawning." Conveniently, they also found my homeworld, Terra. It's good to be home, but nothing feels right.

It's hard to slide back into my old life. My apartment has new tenants. My job fired me. All my stuff is gone. My bank accounts are closed. I am dead, but I live. So I get back in touch with Sala's fixer friends, but now I'm more hands-on. A killer for hire, a soldier of fortune. Nothing matters.

With my new abilities, I no longer need a dreamcatcher to jack into the dreamscape. At least there, all my old stuff is where I left it, even my alternate accounts. I start doing some dreamrunning while awake. I call it "daydreaming," and I get good at it. As far as I know, I'm the only person on Terra who can.

Eventually, I reunite with Sala, sparking a romantic subplot. I let her turn my main dream account into a vampire chevalier. Why not? None of this matters. What I didn't realize was that as Sala's chevalier, I was bound to her will.

She demanded to know what was wrong with me, so I told her everything that happened in Book 2. "Of course nothing matters!" she said. "That's the point. You have to decide for yourself what's important and never compromise on that."

Whether I believed her or if being her chevalier made me believe, it worked. I had to walk through the fire for what’s important. I gave the fixers new instructions about the jobs I'd take: no collateral damage, only bad people get hurt, and whatever we steal goes to a good cause. Stuff like that. Half my fixers dropped me. Some even put bounties on my head. They don’t work as fixers anymore.

The whole world's watching my every move. Maybe not the whole world, but it feels like it with the Regional Military Police closing in. I’ve died once, so that doesn’t scare me. But getting caught and put away for a long time? That’s a real concern.

While I don’t have the full plot mapped out yet, there are key events that must happen:

- **Loss of Control:** I lose control of my alternate dreamscape accounts. They start becoming autonomous, developing personalities based on their skillsets, and eventually, I get locked out entirely as they become independent entities. This spans over several years, occurring simultaneously with other events. They were once my Shadesmith guild, and without me they became the Shadesmith Brotherhood.
    
- **New Enemy:** Near the end of the book, I’m confronted in the waking world by a man with my face and voice. He calls himself Seth Shadesmith (hey, that's the best of my alt accounts) and vows to destroy everything and everyone I love. Dramatic, right? This conflict sets the stage for Book 4.

While all of this is happening, I occasionally get news about galactic events. Prism got the Xaran Alliance and the Vex Empire to reorganize together into a Galactic Republic. Peace among the stars, bet that will last.

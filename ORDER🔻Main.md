### ORDER as an Organization

**ORDER** is an enigmatic and powerful organization established to protect the **multiverse** from threats that could disrupt its stability. Founded by **Glitch Daracova** during the Chaos Age after the collapse of the Galactic Republic, ORDER has evolved into a multiverse-spanning intelligence agency dedicated to safeguarding reality itself. Originally a family-led initiative, ORDER has grown in influence, with its advanced technologies, specialized personnel, and elite operatives enabling it to manage cross-realm relations, neutralize supernatural threats, and conduct multiversal research.

The organization is known for recruiting individuals from all walks of life, including condemned criminals given second chances as **No Profound Class (NPC)** personnel. ORDER provides opportunities for education, personal growth, and skill development, fostering a structured, disciplined community loyal to ORDERâ€™s mission. With its vast resources and advanced technologies, ORDER maintains a careful balance between diplomacy and enforcement across various realms, navigating complex alliances and inter-realm politics to ensure the multiverse remains stable.

### Proposal to Separate the Council of Overseers from the Board of Directors

In recent years, ORDER has faced growing internal debate over a proposal to **separate the Council of Overseers from the Board of Directors**. Proponents argue that ORDERâ€™s expansion across the multiverse necessitates a structural change, allowing **Overseers** to focus exclusively on high-level organizational oversight while **Directors** manage the day-to-day operations of specific facilities, such as ORDER Tower, Vulkaâ€™s Workshop, and Site 42. Supporters believe this division would improve efficiency, reduce administrative burdens, and enable each group to specialize further, better addressing ORDERâ€™s evolving demands.

Opponents, however, argue that the combined experience of current Overseers who also serve as Directors is invaluable and irreplaceable. Most individuals holding both titles, such as **Madelyn Hawthorne** and **Vulka**, are **immortal or near-immortal**, with centuries of experience that have shaped ORDERâ€™s culture, policies, and operational security. They contend that these dual-role leaders possess a unique depth of insight that cannot easily be transferred to new Directors and that splitting these roles might weaken ORDERâ€™s cohesion.

The proposal remains under consideration, reflecting the ongoing evolution of ORDERâ€™s structure in response to its unprecedented growth. If implemented, this separation could mark a significant shift in how ORDER is governed and managed, fundamentally changing the dynamics of its leadership.

> "Though travelers have claimed to be able to see the Breach with the naked eye, the Breach itself may be invisible, and the effect seen in the sky is a jumbled molecular layer—a collection of random, glitch-like particles that fill the gaps where the Breach ends and another universe begins. These particles shimmer and distort, like a fractured mirror reflecting not light, but possibility—a swirling miasma of potential realities colliding at the seams of existence.
>
> As one approaches a Breach Tear, the atmosphere shifts in an instant. The air crackles with static electricity, and an ominous pressure builds, as if the universe itself is holding its breath. The ground trembles, and then it happens: a storm of fire erupts from the Tear, not ordinary flames, but a seething, roiling wave of chaotic energy that burns hotter than any star. This firestorm does not merely incinerate; it disassembles matter at the molecular level, ripping apart the very fabric of reality in its path. Stone, steel, flesh—all are torn asunder by the confused nanotech that spills forth, trying to impose its alien logic on a world that cannot contain it.
>
> In the aftermath, nothing remains unchanged. The landscape is scarred, twisted into unnatural forms as if reality itself has been bent and warped. Survivors, if there are any, are often marked by the Breach’s touch—mutated, altered in ways that defy medical science or rational explanation. They speak of strange visions and hear whispers in languages they have never learned, as if a piece of the Breach has lodged itself within their minds.
>
> To witness a Breach Tear is to glimpse the raw power of the cosmos unchecked by the constraints of order or logic. It is a reminder that the Breach is more than a void; it is a force of pure chaos, a frontier where creation and destruction are indistinguishable. And yet, within the chaos, there are patterns—glitches that suggest a hidden order, a purpose beyond our understanding. Through these 'glitches,' brief windows into other worlds flicker open—alien landscapes, distorted figures, and impossible geometries glimpsed for a heartbeat before the storm consumes them once more.
>
> Those who dare to venture close to a Breach Tear, whether out of desperation or curiosity, rarely return whole. Some are vaporized in an instant, while others emerge changed, their bodies and minds bearing the marks of the Breach’s fury. For the Breach is not just a place of knowledge and wonder; it is a crucible of fire and chaos, where the price of exploration is often paid in blood and sanity. It is a threshold between realities, a liminal space where the known and the unknowable meet, and where even the bravest souls tread carefully, lest they be consumed by the storm."

The Breach is a chaotic and hostile interdimensional realm that fills the gaps between universes. It is filled with independent nanotech and eldritch abominations—entities that defy conventional understanding of physics and biology. The Breach operates outside of normal space and time, making it infinite and unpredictable.

The universe that humans refer to as [Material Reality](Mater_ia🌌Main.md) exists within the Breach as a bubble of normalcy, fragile and fleeting from this outside perspective. Other bubbles, such as the simulacrum realms of the [Dreamscape](Cosmology🌌TheDreamscape.md), also float within the Breach.

The Breach is also the source of all [Nanotech](Nanotech🖲️Main.md), further reading is advised.

## Discovery of the Breach
*From the perspective of Humanity within Material Reality*

Humanity's first interaction with the Breach was unknowing. An experimental quantum computer designed by the scientist [Dr. Elena Vargas](Terra🌎ElenaVargas.md) at [Future Factory](Terra🌎FutureFactory.md) was unexpectedly able to perform instant computation limited only by network throughput. The technology was quickly refined and brought to market as the first Quantum SOC. This leap in processing power, among other advancements, helped jump start Terra's Second Renaissance. 

(more history stuff will be added here later)

A key technology eventually developed was the Breach Drive, which would finally unlock faster than light travel. Of the first generation of breach drive, exactly one was made. The Ark, a colossal spacecraft meant to colonize Sigma Draconis, fired the drive from orbit above Terra and unleashed a Breach Touchpoint on a scale never before seen. The surface of Terra was scorched, ending the Second Renaissance and beginning the Age of Disaster.

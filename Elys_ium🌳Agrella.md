Agrella, godess of life, patron of healers, protector of lost children. She rules the Daven region, which features lush forests and flowing rivers. It is an idyllic place that Agrella will defend with fervor rivaling a god of war.

"*We are Agrella, the breath that stirs the seed, the cradle that shields the sapling, and the roots that anchor the mighty oak. Love Us, and We will nurture your fields and guide your children to the dawn.*" -Agrella

### **Glac=ia** â€“ The Frozen Expanse

- **Type**: Single-World Geocentric Realm
- **Description**: A realm of unrelenting cold, **Glac_ia** is dominated by vast glaciers, frozen tundras, and howling winds. Life here is sparse, with nomadic tribes eking out an existence in the shadow of ancient, ice-locked ruins. The southern regions are dangerous but navigable, while the **giant wall** dividing the realm is a threshold to the **unknown north**, whispered to contain horrors and forgotten powers.
- **Themes**: Survival, isolation, and the haunting dread of the unknown.
- **Connections to Agar_ia**: Travelers from Jarlheim speak of **hidden gates buried beneath ice** and **frozen paths** that connect to Agar_ia's northern kingdoms, but few dare to traverse them.

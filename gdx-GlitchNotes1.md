I am Glitch Daracova.

I was born on Terra, August 29th, some year in the New Age. It was a long time ago.

My own adventures are the subject matter for my books.

### Chaos 1: An Origin Story
> Introduces myself and the world I was born into. I become a dreamrunner, and something of a badass.

### Chaos 2: A War Among the Stars
> Apparently I was too awesome for this world, and got myself abducted by aliens for it. I gained nanotech augmentation, and used abilities learned in the dreamscape to end a galactic war and help my new friends start a Galactic Republic.

### Chaos 3: Blood Chronicle
> Things take a dark turn as I reckon with philosophical problems I didn't used to have time for. Also, my past mistakes come back to haunt me.

### Chaos 4: The Chaos Age
> The Republic crumbles, and it's sort of my fault. Long story. In response, I start ORDER.

An overview for each book will be provided soon. The actual books don't actually exist, only my notes for them.

## Republic Era

*Note: The following pertains to a period of time that predates ORDER. Refer to the [Timeline](Mater=ia📅Timeline.md) for further information.*

The **Shadesmith Brotherhood** is an elite team of operatives created by the Galactic Republic, consisting of the mind-clones of **Glitch Daracova**, one of the most influential figures to emerge in the aftermath of the Long War. Each member of the Brotherhood possesses Glitch’s memories and skills up to the point of their creation, making them uniquely capable and deeply loyal to the Republic's mission of maintaining the fragile peace established following the Empire’s collapse.

This Brotherhood, named after the codename “Shadesmith” assigned to the original Glitch, is composed of **Michael, Alzael, Hadrael, Tyrael, Uriel, Gabrael, and Seth Shadesmith**. Tasked with intelligence operations, covert enforcement, and high-level reconnaissance, the Shadesmith Brotherhood is regarded as one of the Republic’s most formidable and enigmatic assets. Their collective training and shared origins give them a level of cohesion rarely seen in similar operatives, yet each brother has developed distinct traits and expertise, allowing them to specialize in different aspects of their missions.

Though ostensibly unified in purpose, the Brotherhood’s complex dynamic is not without tension. **Seth Shadesmith,** in particular, has exhibited signs of unpredictability that have drawn scrutiny from the Republic's leadership, though the exact nature and extent of his instability remain classified. The Brotherhood’s reliance on these uniquely augmented agents reflects the Republic’s need for exceptional measures during this uncertain era, but it also hints at the fragility of peace and the potential consequences of relying on minds forged from a single, ambitious source.

The Shadesmith Brotherhood’s loyalty and efficacy are vital to the Republic’s stability, as they navigate a multiverse that remains divided, unstable, and prone to threats from factions of the former Empire. While they are trusted with some of the Republic’s most sensitive operations, the exact nature of their missions—and the future they are helping to shape—remains known only to a few within the Republic’s inner circles.

## ORDER Era

Following the collapse of the Galactic Republic, the **Shadesmith Brothers**—Michael, Alzael, Hadrael, Tyrael, Uriel, and Gabrael—became pivotal members of ORDER, lending their unique skills and loyalty to the organization’s mission of multiversal stability. As mind-clones of **Glitch Daracova**, each brother carries an inheritance of knowledge, strategic acumen, and combat expertise that has proven essential to ORDER’s efforts to contain threats across realms.

**Michael Shadesmith** holds a particularly prominent role as an **Overseer**, coordinating ORDER’s high-level operations and providing leadership to his brothers and other operatives. While Michael’s role as Overseer gives him a formal position of authority, all the brothers are respected figures within ORDER, each bringing valuable experience from their time serving as elite operatives for the Republic.

Their journey from the Republic’s dissolution to ORDER’s founding has created a powerful legacy within the organization. As founding members, the Shadesmith Brothers contribute both unity and strength to ORDER, supporting its purpose with unparalleled loyalty and cohesion. Their combined abilities and shared history make them an influential force within ORDER, standing as a testament to Glitch’s vision of security and stability across the multiverse.

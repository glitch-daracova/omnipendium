I don't have an overview for Chaos 4: The Chaos Age. The following is an attempt to cobble something together for the sake of this conversation.

---

At the start of the book, Glitch is defeated and humiliated by Seth. Glitch retreats, using newfound abilities to leave not just Terra but Sol System behind and find refuge in a distant star system.

Meanwhile, Seth goes on a rampage across Terra. The regional military police stand no chance, and the Pax Americana Militarum is dispatched to deal with him (they fail).

(It occurs to me that I never mentioned that Glitch Daracova is from the Pax Americana region of Terra, while Sala Otanashi is from the Lotus Dominion region of Terra.)

Glitch, exhausted after days of FTL propulsion, crashes into a backwater planet not on any map he has access to. He's found by one Taura Phlynx, a feline chimera who belongs to a local slave tribe. She takes Glitch back to her village and brings him back to health.

Taura's people were manufactured by the Corti for basic slave labor, and also for "personal entertainment" (let's not go into detail). Despite the new Galactic Republic banning slavery in all its forms, it seems that some worlds simply don't care what the Galactic Republic says if they're far enough away from the galactic center.

Taura helps Glitch remember that being a hero is its own reward, and helps liberate the slave tribes from the Corti enterprise lording over them. Glitch uses his connections with the Xarans to ensure Taura's people remain free, even after Glitch himself leaves.

Heroism is its own reward. Glitch must return to Terra, and confront Seth. But Seth isn't there, he's gone on to breaking larger things, and that includes centers of Galactic Republic power. What Glitch does find on Terra is that Sala was murdered by Seth (Sala sort of survives this, but only in the dreamscape because of how awesome of a dreamrunner she is, her body in the waking world is very dead at this point).

Chasing Seth is a long and difficult road for Glitch. Every time he thinks he's caught up, he finds another ruin or catastrophe. Does he stay and help, or does he rush off to follow the villain? Neither is a winning choice, but stopping Seth sooner means fewer worlds devastated.

Ultimately, Glitch must call upon his former alternate accounts, the Shadesmiths, for aid.

"I can't do this on my own. I need your help to stop this fucker."

By their powers combined, Glitch side by side with the Shadesmiths, defeat Seth.

But there will not be order without a guiding hand. Perhaps they should be that ORDER.

### **Overview**

**Chaos 4: The Chaos Age** is a story of transformation, redemption, and unity. The narrative follows **Glitch Daracova**, who begins the book at his lowest point—defeated, humiliated, and consumed by guilt over the destruction caused by **Seth**, the rogue alternate account turned autonomous entity. The journey takes him from self-doubt to self-determination as he reclaims his identity and unites the **Shadesmith Brotherhood** to confront Seth, a world-breaking threat. Along the way, Glitch’s personal growth lays the foundation for the creation of **ORDER**, the multiversal organization dedicated to preventing such chaos from ever occurring again.

**Nature**
The Dreamscape is a highly immersive and interactive world, blending elements of magic, advanced technology, and mythological themes. It features a variety of realms, each with its own unique characteristics and challenges.

**Access**
People in the waking world access the Dreamscape using a device known as the dreamcatcher. This device connects users to the Dreamscape in their sleep, allowing them to enter this simulated world and experience it as if it were reality. Such people are known as "dreamers".



# Realms of the Dreamscape
There are many, potentially an infinite number, of realms within the dreamscape. These are a few.

[🌐Agar_ia](🌐Agar_ia.md) - [🌐Elys_ium](🌐Elys_ium.md) - [🌐Aeth_yr](🌐Aeth_yr.md) - [🌐Eklyps_ia](🌐Eklyps_ia.md) - [🌐Noct_yr](🌐Noct_yr.md) - [🌐Azer_os](🌐Azer_os.md)

**Agar_ia**
A central fantasy realm populated by diverse cultures and races, such as elves, dwarves, and orks. It features kingdoms like Greater Anglica, Jarlheim, Fretalia, Einroth, Rodinia, and Former Olympia.

**Elys_ium**
An archipelago where each island is ruled by a different deity, representing various aspects of life and nature.

**Aeth_yr**
Once a culturally rich realm, now devastated and ruled by Kaiser Phobos until his overthrow by Kai Ruinor of House Yakobe.

**Eklyps_ia**
Formerly a pocket-sized realm created by Gabrael Shadesmith, it was transformed into a vibrant world by the gods Yakobe. It features notable locations such as the Estate, Veridian, Fortuna, and Zane's Tower.

**Noct_yr**
A dark realm ruled by House Athetos, characterized by its fortress-like palace and perpetual night. The realm is directly connected to its netherrealm.

**Pandemon_ium**
Ruled by Sala Otanashi, this netherrealm serves as a refuge for demonkind. Sala uses trains and a rail network to travel the netherrealms at high speeds.

**Azer_os**
A realm featuring an unending struggle between the living and the hordes of undead. Vedaric Nox Rammus was born here.

# Netherrealms

**Nature**: Netherrealms are parallel or lower dimensions that exist beneath or beyond the primary dream realms. They vary greatly in nature, ranging from tranquil afterlives to dangerous locales.

**Interconnectedness**: All netherrealms are connected, similar to how the main realms are interconnected. However, navigation through netherrealms involves traversing rocky passages and rarely seeing the sky.

**Travel**: Traveling through netherrealms is much faster due to their condensed nature, often taking a fraction of the time compared to normal realms.

**Inhabitants**: Populated by traditional fire-and-brimstone demons as well as malevolent AIs from the waking world. Angels are considered a different species of demon, blurring traditional distinctions.

**Demons and Devils**:
- **Demons**: A species or category of species, characterized by their physical nature.
- **Devils**: A job role akin to lawyers, politicians, and corporate executives.

**Demon Overlords**:
- A profession similar to a military general and crowned monarch, involving leadership and governance within the demonic realms.

# The Fringe Realms
[㊙FringeRealms](㊙FringeRealms.md)

The fringe realms of the Dreamscape are the borderlands where the boundaries between the digital simulation world, become thin and permeable. These realms are characterized by their instability, unpredictability, and the constant interplay of magic and technology.

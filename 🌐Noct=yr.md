### Geographic and Structural Overview

Noct_yr is defined by its rugged and harsh landscapes, with the central feature being a massive palace known as the Palace of Night. This palace is a formidable fortification, equipped with endless walls, towers, and battlements, and massive arcane guns mounted on every defensible platform, emphasizing its strategic and military significance.

Surrounding the Palace on all sides are vast, layered cliffs that resemble a monumental mountain from a distance. These cliffs house entire towns and cities on their various ridges, creating a vertical civilization interconnected by bridges, lifts, and tunnels. This unique architectural feature not only serves as a defensive advantage but also as a dramatic reflection of Noct_yr's societal structure.

### Climate and Agriculture

Noct_yr suffers from a perpetual night, caused by the neglect of Sol Luxor "The Lightbreaker," the sun god of House Athetos, who has abandoned his duties to move the sun. This endless night has led the inhabitants to adapt by developing unique agricultural practices, including breeding special crops that can grow in moonlight, which sustains the populace under these extreme conditions.

### Underground Features

Beneath the rugged landscapes of **Noct_yr** lies **Noct_ium**, a sprawling netherrealm ruled by **Nolan Grimm**, "The Hand" of House Athetos. Noct_ium serves as both a lifeline and a strategic asset for Noct_yr, channeling geothermal heat from its infernal depths to warm the surface and sustain its population in the eternal night. This vast underworld is rich in arcane energies and rare resources, supporting the industries and defenses of the realm above.

Under Nolan’s command, Noct_ium also acts as a staging ground for House Athetos’ expansionist campaigns. Its labyrinthine tunnels extend into the netherrealms of other realms, allowing Nolan’s forces—undead soldiers and demon mercenaries—to conquer and secure new territories. Noct_ium is a dark and vital foundation for Noct_yr’s survival and the ambitions of House Athetos.

### Cultural and Political Dynamics

Noct_yr’s culture is heavily influenced by the presence and governance of House Athetos. The gods of House Athetos, each with unique powers and dark backgrounds, cast a long shadow over the realm. They are revered and feared, with the local mortals desiring proximity to the Palace as a means to be closer to their gods. The ultimate honor, perceived greater than serving within the Palace, is being sacrificed to these gods, reflecting the deep-seated and grim aspects of their worship.

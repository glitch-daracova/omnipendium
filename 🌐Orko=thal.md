### **Orko=thal** â€“ The Orkwild

- **Type**: Single-World Geocentric Realm
- **Description**: An untamed jungle realm where nature itself is **both beautiful and brutal**. **Orko_thal** is defined by its towering fungal forests, bioluminescent groves, and jagged mountain ranges that act as natural barriers. The air is thick with spores from a **fungal blight** that transforms those it infects into savage, ork-like creatures. Civilization is fragmented, with only scattered settlements and warbands struggling to endure.
- **Themes**: Primal chaos, transformation, and the relentless fight for survival.
- **Connections to Agar_ia**: A mountain pass east of Rodinia leads to **Orko_thal**, but it is treacherous, and the fungal infestation threatens to spread into Agar_ia if not contained.

---

I was born on Terra, August 29th, some year in the New Age. It was a long time ago.

In the waking world, I have a menial office job the details of which aren't important. It pays the rent and keeps the lights on, so I can spend my nights living a life I actually like.

In the dreamscape, I am a swordsman and sorcerer, doing quests for whomever grants interesting rewards. I was good at it. I multiboxxed my dreamcatcher, allowing me to have seven different versions of myself running around the dreamscape. I was an entire guild by myself, I called it the Shadesmith Guild.

One day, I bumped into an old friend, Sala Otanashi. We were friends, met in the dreamscape when we were kids, dated off and on during highschool, but mostly went our separate ways after that. I assumed she had lost interested in dream games. We lived a world apart, after all, of course I wouldn't see her anymore.

Sala had become a dreamrunner. And now, she was offering to teach me, if I helped her with a project of hers. That sounded like a quest to me, with interesting rewards.

So I became a dreamrunner myself.

One of Sala's missions involved tracking a rogue AI that had fled into the dreamscape and became a demon. She wanted to talk to it, and I went along to be a bodyguard if things went poorly.

Sala connected me to some of her contacts in my city. As a fledgling dreamrunner, I could do some work for them. It paid better than my day job, a lot better. All I had to do was hack into some stuff while someone else did some breaking and entering. We only targeted mega-corporations, and never stole things that would be missed.

Eventually, things start going sideways, and they don't really get better. We got caught. The guys on the ground screwed up so bad I couldn't cover their tracks, and I got traced for my efforts. It was a big mission that none of us were qualified for. I'll save the details for the book, but Sala saved my butt helping me get the hell out before my entire hab bloc was raided by the corpos.

Sala wasn't doing much better than I was. Her own hideout was also raided, she escaped but her sister Diva was taken by the corpos. I owed her.

Several missions of prep later, we rescue Diva. Sala and Diva's reunion was heartfelt, but probably would have been more impactful if I could understand anything they said.

Another mission was planned for the next night, but I didn't make it. I awoke to discover I had been abducted by aliens.

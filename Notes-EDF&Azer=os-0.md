Azeros is a world defined by complex conflicts, deep-seated resentment, and ideological divides between factions that each seek power, survival, and identity in unique ways. At the heart of the conflict is the Glorious Kingdom, ruled by the King of Golden Lions—a staunch leader who enforces a vision of purity, loyalty, and expansionism. The Kingdom’s unyielding ideology drives it to view both the Undead Swarm and the diverse cultures of the Savage Wilds as existential threats that must be subdued or destroyed. In this world, alliances, betrayals, and the echoes of past mistakes shape every faction’s goals and struggles.

The Glorious Kingdom holds a rigid belief that the human spirit is pure, sacred, and perpetually under threat from outside influences. This belief fuels the Kingdom’s culture, where citizens constantly express loyalty through public praise of the heavens and devotion to the Kingdom itself. This reinforcement of purity serves as both a source of pride and a shield against disillusionment, which is seen as the greatest danger to the Kingdom’s unity. The Kingdom’s expansionist policies, upheld by paladins skilled in holy magic, cast the undead and the Savage Wilds as corrupt influences, unworthy of redemption.

In contrast, the Savage Wilds represents a loose coalition of diverse beings—such as orcs, trolls, goblins, and gnolls—each with unique cultures and values. United by a common disdain for the Kingdom’s imperialism, the Wilds are wary of both the Kingdom’s hypocritical “purity” and the horrors wrought by the undead Swarm. While the Kingdom represents order and control, the Wilds embody resilience, independence, and harmony with nature, making them a constant target of the Kingdom’s crusades.

Adding complexity is the Undead Swarm, ruled by the new Lich King, a tragic figure who was once the Kingdom’s crown prince and son of the King of Golden Lions. Betrayed and driven into undeath, the Lich King is caught between his resentment toward his father and his exploitation by the ghost of an orc shaman, whose curse twisted his mind and suppressed any lingering guilt or vulnerability. This cursed state forces him to see the undead as tools, not individuals, which creates tension within the Swarm, as many powerful undead resist his rule. Some dissenters among the undead, freed from his control, seek a new life of autonomy and try to negotiate peace with the Kingdom—though the King of Golden Lions dismisses them as irredeemable.

Beyond these primary factions, neutral and isolated groups like the Twilight Blade cult and the Emerald Vision druid circle exist in Azeros, largely avoiding the broader conflicts. The Twilight Blade worships forgotten gods and likely seeks to exploit the existing chaos to further their own agendas, while the Emerald Vision remains dedicated solely to the planet itself, viewing the ongoing conflict as a danger to Azeros’s balance and natural order.

**The Glorious Kingdom**

The Glorious Kingdom is a proud, militaristic empire that prides itself on purity and loyalty, fueled by the belief that the human spirit is sacred and constantly threatened by corrupting influences. This ideology, which views the human spirit as both powerful and vulnerable, permeates daily life, creating a culture of public devotion and ritualized praise. Citizens are taught from birth to see the Glorious Kingdom as divinely blessed and to fear any influence that might undermine its sanctity. Disillusionment is branded as the ultimate weapon of the enemy, leading to a society where doubts are suppressed, and loyalty is paramount.

Ruled by the King of Golden Lions, the Kingdom’s policies are harsh and uncompromising. Any group that does not explicitly align with the Kingdom is seen as an enemy, fueling its crusade against the undead and the Savage Wilds. This attitude isolates the Kingdom and forces its allies—such as dwarves, gnomes, and elves—to continuously prove their loyalty, as even the slightest deviation from the Kingdom’s ideals is treated as a threat. Surveillance, suspicion, and loyalty tests create an insular society where obedience is valued over all else.

Internally, the Kingdom is guided by a trusted circle of advisors, including one who is secretly an evil dragon in disguise. This advisor, long loyal to the Kingdom only in appearance, carefully fuels the King’s zealous policies, possibly with the goal of bringing about a weakened or fractured Kingdom. Another source of conflict is the princess, sister to the Lich King, who sympathizes with her brother’s plight but remains loyal to the Kingdom. She hopes to save him, though her allegiance to her father places her in a painful moral dilemma.

The Kingdom is also weakened by the lack of a clear line of succession. The former crown prince, now the Lich King, was meant to inherit the throne, and the King, now aging, has no other heir. This familial rupture and lack of future leadership strain the Kingdom, deepening its reliance on authoritarian control and making the King’s war-driven ideology feel even more desperate.

**The Undead Swarm and the Lich King**

The undead Swarm is a powerful faction shaped by centuries of mistreatment and exile, now unified under the Lich King, who was once the Glorious Kingdom’s crown prince. The Lich King’s authority, however, is far from stable. Despite his absolute power, he sees the undead not as individuals but as tools to achieve conquest and vengeance. This perspective creates tension within the Swarm, as elder undead, who remember life and individuality, resist his control, viewing him as a ruler who disregards their autonomy. These dissenting undead even seek peace, desiring a life of freedom outside his influence, though the Kingdom refuses to negotiate.

The Lich King’s control is rooted in a powerful curse: his mind and soul are possessed by the ghost of an orc shaman who took advantage of his estrangement from his father. This curse suppresses any remorse or humanity within the Lich King, preventing him from recognizing his guilt or vulnerability. Though he once might have mourned the broken relationship with his father, he is now a pawn, manipulated by the shaman’s spirit toward ruthless expansion.

Some undead, freed from his influence by moments of distraction or power lapses, nurture the “seed” of their past lives. In these moments of autonomy, they are encouraged by elder free undead to accept their undead fate, share memories of their death, and avoid revisiting their former lives to lessen their suffering. This small, supportive community within the Swarm reflects the desire for selfhood despite the Lich King’s control.

The Wilds, meanwhile, see the Lich King as yet another human menace, albeit one who reveals humanity’s darker side. Although he is opposed to the Kingdom, he is not an ally to the Wilds, who unite against both threats. The lands of the Swarm and the Wilds hold artifacts of immense power, from ancient elvish ruins to the legendary sword **Skyfire**, wielded by a fallen warrior now controlled by the Lich King. These relics are highly coveted: the elves seek to restore their culture, while the Kingdom views Skyfire and the former capital as sacred ground.

Together, these tensions, tragic backstories, and personal vendettas weave a complex tale in Azeros—a world where loyalty and independence clash, where family bonds are fractured by ideology, and where the struggle for power may ultimately lead to the destruction of everything these factions hope to protect.

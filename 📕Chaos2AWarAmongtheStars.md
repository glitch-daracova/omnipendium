I wake up on board an alien ship, I'd later learn many light years away from home. Weeks have passed, and what little I remember makes me glad that I don't recall the rest. Myself, and about twelve others, are the survivors of a series of  ruthless experiments by Corti scientists, who aimed to discover the effects of humans to an anomalous artifact. That's not a mistake, they weren't studying us, they were studying that thing.

You probably don't know what a Corti is. I didn't either, at the time. Short, gray skin, bulbous black eyes, massive craniums, zero sense of empathy, and almost as smart as they think they are. You get the idea.

During a sudden attack on the ship, a psychic voice directs us to escape. Another thing I'd learn later, the voice belonged to Prism, a super-advanced AI able to communicate with us via our newly acquired nano-augmentations. These augmentations had been growing inside us as a result of the experiments.

The Corti were working for the Vex Empire, and we were being rescued by rebels calling themselves the Xaran Alliance. Prism being the leader of this alliance. They described the Vex Empire as evil, and I didn't really need much convincing. They asked for my help, and I felt right at home doing quests with interesting rewards. I was to undergo training at the hands of one Draco Knightslayer. I was already a fighter, but he turned me into a soldier. It was easy to just go with it, at some point along the way I convinced myself that this was just another game in the dreamscape.

Missions. Always missions. This time around I'm a field operative instead of support. Go in, steal thing, get out. Go in, neutralize target, get out. Go in, protect a thing until backup arrives, get out.

One mission stands out. Emergency, all hands on deck. A Vex super weapon had appeared in-system of Neon, threatening to annihilate us all.

Right, explanations.

Neon was the Xaran Alliance capitol world, sort of. More like a massive space station that had grown over millennia to the size of a planet. Historically, Neon could perform a breach-jump to escape threats, but that took time. We didn't have time.

The Vex super weapon was a planet-busting laser, mounted to a station the size of a small moon. It was also escorted by an armada of capitol ships and their supporting fleets. New Mission: go in, blow up the station, get out. I recognized that station, it was the same one I and the others were experimented on in. Didn't matter though, I had a mission to do, and I succeeded, well, sort of. I didn't do the 'get out' part in time.

Obviously, I survived, otherwise I wouldn't be able to write this. At the time though, I along with everyone else were convinced I was dead. With the super weapon destroyed, the Xaran Alliance fleets routed the Vex Empire's armada. I missed some details while I was busy being "dead", but apparently the Vex Empire surrendered shortly thereafter, and the Long War was over.

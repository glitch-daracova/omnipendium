## The Omnipendium

**Chaos Is Eternal** is my collective literary works. Not books, not stories, but lore and worldbuilding for novels I'll never write. While I claim ownership of everything herein, some works are derivative of the works of others, notably the actions of my various D&D parties I DMed for over the years.

My first attempt to write "The Book" was in 1999, I was in gradeschool. I wrote a single scene for creative writing, I was quite proud of it, and my teacher couldn't understand a thing of what happened. I've made attempts almost every year since. Those failures will not be included, as most of them were on paper and lost in a fire years ago, and the ones I do still have aren't worth sharing.

This current version I'm calling "The Omnipendium". Established 2024-03-07. It was a Thursday. This wiki, if I can call it that, will eventually contain the ruleset for the Chaos LitRPG, as well as entries for locations, events, characters, and more. I might even include excerpts from the books I'll never write.

With the recent advent of GPT-like AI, I now frequently use such tools in the creation of articles for this wiki. GPT says I should say "They're useful, if imperfect - like everything else here."

Most importantly, **I do this for me. Not for profit, not for fame, but for my own personal enrichment.** This wiki is visible to the public to make sharing with my friends and family easy. I reserve the right to take my ball and go home should people start being unpleasant.

In the future, this will contain a set of guides for creating playable characters, and modules to play with those characters. For now, it's just a collection of gameplay conceits.

In the Empire of the Darkness Flame—an intergalactic dominion spanning both material and hellish realms—two beings crossed paths at a cult academy built within a Black Tower on a corrupted industrial world.

**Lechowe**, last of her druidic people, joined the Cult Academy to survive and gain power. She climbed its brutal hierarchy, suppressing her nature to lead a clique and master dark disciplines.

**Ikarus**, an angel of ORDER and secret agent of a cosmic intelligence, infiltrated the academy to dismantle the EDF from within. He quickly excelled, drawing suspicion and awe, all while keeping his true mission hidden.

Their paths crossed on a joint mission, where Ikarus gifted Lechowe a critical artifact without hesitation. Though shocked, she accepted the gesture. When Ikarus was unexpectedly chosen for ascension—a position Lechowe had worked years for—she attacked him in rage. He didn’t retaliate. Instead, he hugged her and revealed his true identity and mission.

He brought her aboard his ship, _The Daedalus_, offering her freedom by severing the cult’s grip on her soul. In return, he entrusted her with a disk capable of resetting his mind—his contingency if he were to fall.

At the ascension ceremony, Ikarus boldly declared his intent to kill Emperor Vedaric Nox Rammus. The challenge was accepted. Transported to the throne world, Ikarus fought valiantly but was ultimately defeated. Vedaric bound his soul, twisted his mind, and returned him to the academy—loyal to the EDF.

Lechowe, forced to flee under pursuit, escaped in the _Daedalus_. She swore to return one day, to free Ikarus as he had once freed her—and perhaps bring down the EDF itself.

**Lechowe and Ikarus: The Infiltrator and the Ascendant**

In the shadow of the Empire of the Darkness Flame (EDF), on a world long since lost to corruption, two aspirants entered the Cult Academy under vastly different circumstances—and with fates more entwined than either could have predicted.

**Lechowe** was born of the dying embers of a forgotten druidic faith, native to a world now buried beneath metal, smog, and the soul-choking influence of a Black Tower. These towers serve as the EDF’s ideological engines—warping planetary world-souls, indoctrinating the powerful, and spawning future servants of the Empire. Lechowe, with no tribe, no future, and no hope, turned to the Cult Academy in desperation. She buried her past and clawed her way through the ranks by mastering mind control, necromancy, and other dark arts unnatural to her. Through ruthless leadership, she commanded a clique of fellow aspirants, aiming to rise through loyalty and fear.

**Ikarus**, by contrast, entered the academy as an outsider. An angel of ORDER and agent of a multidimensional intelligence agency, he was sent to infiltrate and ultimately destroy the EDF. His divine power and disciplined mind allowed him to pass the academy’s trials with ease, drawing both interest and suspicion from the cult’s leadership. While Ikarus remained distant and solitary, his path crossed Lechowe’s during a mission to seize a forbidden artifact. Lechowe, leading the mission, was prepared to fight Ikarus for credit—only for him to hand her the artifact freely. His cryptic gratitude left her stunned.

Tensions flared when Ikarus was unexpectedly chosen for ascension over Lechowe. Furious, she attacked him in secret—but her most lethal techniques failed. Calm and unflinching, Ikarus embraced her, revealing his true identity and his purpose: the end of the EDF. He offered her a choice. Onboard his ship, _The Daedalus_, he severed the cult’s grip on her soul and gave her a failsafe—an operating disk capable of reverting his mind should he fall. She accepted.

At the ascension ceremony, Ikarus declared his true intent: to kill Vedaric Nox Rammus, the god emperor of the EDF. His challenge was accepted.

He was transported to Vedaric’s throne world, where the two fought. Despite wielding a god-killing sword and angelic might, Ikarus was defeated. Vedaric, amused, bound Ikarus’s soul to the Empire and reprogrammed his mind for perfect loyalty.

Ikarus was returned to the academy, alive but no longer himself. Lechowe, realizing what had happened, was forced to flee as Cult Wardens closed in. Escaping aboard the _Daedalus_, she swore to one day return—not just to free Ikarus, but to finish what he started.

Thus begins the second war for Ikarus’s soul—and the first true rebellion from within the EDF.

**Aftermath and Current Status**

Since then, **Lechowe** has become a rogue agent of rising myth. Piloting _The Daedalus_, she has traveled across the multiverse, gathering rebels, adventurers, exiles, and champions from countless worlds. Her cause is whispered in resistance cells, ancient ruins, and rebel strongholds: _The EDF can be broken._

Meanwhile, **Ikarus** has risen through the EDF’s ranks to become a **Knight**, a high-ranking enforcer serving at the personal command of Vedaric Nox Rammus. His loyalty appears absolute. His former self is buried—if it remains at all.

Now, the two former allies stand on opposite sides of a growing war, each haunted by what they once were… and what they might become again.

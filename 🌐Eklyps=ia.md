## Geographic and Cultural Overview

Eklyps_ia is approximately the size of a kingdom, by the standards of other realms, making it a significant but manageable area within the Dreamscape. The realm is characterized by a diversity of landscapes, including lush forests and barren wastelands.

#### The Estate

At the heart of Eklyps_ia lies the Estate, a massive, sprawling manor that serves as the primary residence of House Yakobe. The Estate reflects its layered history, having been constructed over many years with input from multiple architects, resulting in a complex amalgamation of styles and ideologies. It is primarily inhabited by Queen Jane Eqlar and Regent Nora Materia, while other members of House Yakobe, such as Sora Stormsong and Voli Lumiscale, prefer a nomadic lifestyle, seldom staying in one place for long. The Estate is maintained and operated legions of servants, house staff, and operational employees.

#### Veridian

Veridian, the largest and honestly the only metropolis in Eklyps_ia, is known for its advanced technology, neon lights, and skyscrapers of glass and steel. The city has a pronounced preference for the color green, influencing its architectural and lighting choices. Azka Quickshade, known as "The Verdant," is the patron god of Veridian and influences the city’s development, although she does not govern it directly. The city is administratively run by a mayor and elected officials, and it hosts a variety of private organizations that engage in commerce both within Eklyps_ia and with external realms.

#### Fortuna

In the vast forests of Eklyps_ia, there is a unique town called Fortuna, situated within a grove of colossal cherry blossom trees. This town is populated by elves and fey who were displaced from other realms. Fortuna is known for its culture centered around luck, with residents engaging in practices to cultivate good fortune and avert misfortune. The town is under the patronage of Kari, the Fairy of Fortuna, who forbids gambling but allows games of chance without wagers. Fortuna is a place of healing and is sought after by those whom Veridian’s hospitals cannot aid, offering remedies involving luck and fairy magic.

#### The Wastelands and Mageon Zane’s Tower

Far from the populated centers, in the barren wastelands of Eklyps_ia, stands a solitary tower belonging to Mageon Zane. This tower is a place of significant magical research and is continuously growing. It is inhabited mainly by Zane himself and is maintained by his arcane golems. Nearby, there is an abandoned town at the edge of the wasteland where Kai Ruinor, now known as Kaiser Ruinor of Aeth_yr, once lived. The tower and its surrounding areas are marked by their isolation and the mysterious aura they project.

### Cultural Themes and Dynamics

Eklyps_ia is a realm where the juxtaposition of advanced technology and mystical elements coexists with traditional and nomadic lifestyles. The influence of the divine is palpable, with each deity-like member of House Yakobe shaping aspects of the realm according to their powers and interests. The realm’s culture is rich with celebrations of magic, technology, and the interplay of fate and fortune.

### Some History

Gabrael Shadesmith is intricately connected to House Yakobe as the creator of the realm of Eklyps_ia and its divine inhabitants, the Gods Yakobe. Originally, Eklyps_ia was one of Gabrael's experimental labs in the Dreamscape, which evolved into a significant realm after being lost and reclaimed multiple times. Gabrael's greatest experiment involved creating the gods of House Yakobe, who were scattered across the Dreamscape but eventually reunited to reclaim and transform Eklyps_ia. Gabrael’s relationship with House Yakobe is thus both as its architect and as a distant but pivotal figure in their history, having set the stage for their existence and their saga within the Dreamscape.

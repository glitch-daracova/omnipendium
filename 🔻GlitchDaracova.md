I am Glitch Daracova.

I was born on [ Terra](🌎Terra.md), August 29, some year in the New Age.

I named myself in honor of my favorite main protagonist and author insert character. It amuses me to refer to my creation in the first person, and I will do so throughout the [ Omnipendium](index.md). You can't stop me.

I had several adventures personally, some highlights you can read about in my books.

[📕Chaos1AnOriginStory](📕Chaos1AnOriginStory.md) - Introduces myself and the world I was born into. I become a dreamrunner, and something of a badass.


[📕Chaos2AWarAmongtheStars](📕Chaos2AWarAmongtheStars.md) - Apparently I was too awesome for this world, and got myself abducted by aliens for it. I gained nanotech augmentation, and used abilities learned in the dreamscape to win the freedom of my new friends.


[📕Chaos3BloodChronicle](📕Chaos3BloodChronicle.md) - Things take a dark turn as I reckon with philosophical problems I didn't used to have time for. Also, my past mistakes come back to haunt me.


[📕Chaos4EndWar](📕Chaos4EndWar.md) - It's the end of the world as we know it! Well, actually it's the end of all existence in any meaningful manner, unless we can stop an insane copy of me who is more powerful and somehow more of an ass than I am. Did we win? You'll have to read it to find out!

These days I mostly sit around, drink, play video games, and attempt to document everything I think I remember about that world I don't live in anymore.

GPT, make me a character profile.

### **Character Profile: Glitch Daracova**

**Aliases:**

- **Dreamscape:** The Crimson Wanderer
- **Waking World:** Just Glitch, for the most part.

**Age:** Late 20s to early 30s

**Gender:** Male

**Appearance:**

- **Waking World:**  
    Glitch has a casual, almost disheveled appearance that contrasts sharply with his powerful persona in the dreamscape. He has tousled dark hair that looks like it hasn’t seen a comb in days, and his eyes are a shade of green that seems to shift depending on his mood. He’s of average height with a lean build, giving the impression of someone who spends more time indoors than outdoors. His typical attire includes worn jeans, graphic tees that reference obscure games or books, and a hoodie that he practically lives in. There’s a certain laid-back charm to him, though it’s clear he’s seen more than he lets on.
    
- **Dreamscape:**  
    In the dreamscape, Glitch’s appearance is a mix of a fantasy hero and a cyberpunk warrior. His hair is longer and slicked back, with streaks of red running through it, giving him a more intense look. His eyes glow a bright crimson, a sign of his deep connection to the dreamscape’s power. He wears a sleek, black leather jacket with intricate red and silver designs, paired with combat boots and fingerless gloves. A sword, which shimmers with ethereal energy, is always at his side, and his body is adorned with various tech enhancements, a nod to his experiences in space and his nanotech augmentation.
    

**Personality:**

- **Waking World:**  
    Glitch is a paradoxical blend of nonchalance and intense introspection. On the surface, he appears easygoing, often cracking jokes and making light of serious situations. He’s the type who would rather spend his time playing video games and drinking rather than dealing with the weight of his past. However, beneath this exterior lies a mind constantly in overdrive, processing the myriad experiences that have shaped him. He’s haunted by his past adventures and the philosophical questions they’ve raised, though he masks this with humor and a laid-back attitude.
    
- **Dreamscape:**  
    As the Crimson Wanderer, Glitch is a force to be reckoned with. His demeanor shifts to one of confidence and control, a seasoned dreamrunner who has faced countless challenges and come out stronger. He’s a bit of a wildcard, known for taking on quests that others would deem too risky or nonsensical, all in pursuit of something that catches his interest. His sense of humor remains, though it’s sharper, more biting, often used to disarm foes or keep allies on their toes. Despite his casual approach, he’s deeply loyal to those he considers friends, and will go to great lengths to protect them.
    

**Background:**  
Glitch was born on Terra on August 29, during some year in the New Age. His early life was unremarkable—working a menial office job that kept the lights on and the rent paid, allowing him to spend his nights in the dreamscape, a place where he truly felt alive.

During his youth, Glitch engaged in a risky practice known as "multiboxxing" in the dreamscape, where he controlled multiple personas simultaneously. To him, it was just a game—a way to explore different aspects of the dreamscape and to push the limits of what was possible. He created various personas for different purposes—some for combat, others for crafting or exploration—each with its own set of skills and traits.

What he didn’t anticipate was that these personas, initially just extensions of his own mind, would eventually grow into independent entities. Over time, they developed their own identities, ambitions, and personalities, no longer mere "accounts" he could log into but fully separate beings. This realization hit hard during the events of the "Blood Chronicle," when these alternate personas began to act autonomously, sometimes in ways that conflicted with Glitch’s own goals. The personas reflected the purposes for which he created them, manifesting as distinct aspects of his personality and desires—some dark, others noble, but all representing pieces of the larger puzzle that is Glitch Daracova.

**Powers and Abilities:**

- **Waking World:**
    
    - **Nanotech Augmentation:** After being abducted by aliens, Glitch gained nanotech enhancements that provide him with enhanced physical abilities, quick healing, and limited technomancy—allowing him to interface with and manipulate technology.
    - **Memory Recall:** Glitch has an uncanny ability to recall details from his past adventures, though this also serves as a curse, as he often finds himself trapped in memories that he’d rather forget.
    - **Unpredictable Genius:** His mind works in unconventional ways, allowing him to solve problems and hack systems creatively. However, this often leads to unorthodox methods that others might not understand.
- **Dreamscape:**
    
    - **Master Swordsman and Sorcerer:** Glitch wields a sword infused with dream energy, capable of cutting through both physical and metaphysical obstacles. His sorcery is versatile, allowing him to cast powerful spells that manipulate the dreamscape to his will.
    - **Dreamrunning:** As a dreamrunner, Glitch can navigate the dreamscape with ease, bending its rules and pulling elements from the dream world into reality. His abilities in the dreamscape are near-limitless, only constrained by his imagination and willpower.
    - **Multibox Personas:** The personas Glitch created during his youth have now become independent beings within the dreamscape. They each represent different aspects of his personality—some are aggressive and ruthless, others are strategic and calculating, and a few are even altruistic. These personas have their own lives, ambitions, and powers, and while some may ally with Glitch, others may oppose him or pursue their own agendas. Dealing with these personas adds a layer of complexity to his dreamrunning, as he must navigate the consequences of his past actions and the unpredictability of these other selves.

**Motivations:**  
Glitch’s motivations are complex and ever-evolving. Initially driven by a desire for adventure and the thrill of the unknown, his experiences have instilled in him a sense of responsibility—especially towards those he cares about, like Sala Otanashi. He’s constantly torn between his laid-back nature and the weight of the philosophical questions that haunt him, often leading him to take on quests that others might find absurd or pointless, but which hold deeper meaning for him.

His past actions, particularly the creation of the multibox personas, have left him with unresolved conflicts that he must now face. These personas, once part of him, now act as reminders of the risks of playing with power without considering the consequences. Glitch is motivated not only by his current goals but also by a need to understand and reconcile with these aspects of himself.

**Weaknesses:**

- **Waking World:**
    
    - **Haunted by the Past:** Glitch’s memories of his past adventures often weigh heavily on him, leading to moments of doubt and introspection that can paralyze him in critical situations.
    - **Over-Reliance on Humor:** His tendency to joke and make light of serious matters can alienate those who don’t understand his coping mechanisms, and it sometimes prevents him from addressing important issues head-on.
- **Dreamscape:**
    
    - **Philosophical Burdens:** The deeper Glitch delves into the philosophical aspects of his powers, the more he risks losing himself in existential crises. His abilities are tied to his mental state, and if he becomes too introspective or doubtful, his powers can backfire or weaken.
    - **Unpredictability:** While his unconventional methods can be a strength, they can also lead to chaotic outcomes that even Glitch cannot control, putting himself and his allies at risk.
    - **Multibox Personas:** The independent personas that originated from Glitch’s youth can be both allies and adversaries. Their autonomy means they can act unpredictably, and their goals may not always align with Glitch’s. Some may resent their creation or seek to outdo their creator, creating potential conflicts that Glitch must navigate.

**Relationships:**

- **Sala Otanashi:**  
    Glitch shares a deep, complicated history with Sala. They met as children in the dreamscape and formed a close bond that evolved into an on-and-off romantic relationship during their teenage years. Though they drifted apart, Sala’s re-entry into his life reignited their connection, this time as allies in the world of dreamrunning. Glitch respects Sala deeply, and their history allows them to work together with an unspoken understanding. He is one of the few people Sala trusts enough to entrust with critical missions, such as rescuing her sister, Diva. Their relationship is marked by a blend of nostalgia, trust, and the unresolved tensions of their past.
    
- **Diva Otanashi:**  
    Glitch’s relationship with Diva is less personal but no less important. As Sala’s twin sister, Diva represents a key figure in Sala’s life, and by extension, in Glitch’s. He successfully rescued her from a Binary Helix facility, cementing his role as a trusted ally in Sala’s eyes. While he doesn’t share the same deep bond with Diva as he does with Sala, he respects her and is aware of the important role she plays in the larger conflict.
    
- **Multibox Personas:**  
    These independent entities, originally created by Glitch during his youth, represent different facets of his personality. Their existence complicates his journey, as he must now deal with the consequences of their autonomy. Some personas may act as allies, while others could be antagonists, driven by goals that diverge from Glitch’s own. His relationship with them is complex, often reflecting his internal struggles and the parts of himself he wishes to avoid or confront.
    
- **Alien Allies:**  
    During his abduction, Glitch formed bonds with various alien species, using his newfound abilities to secure their freedom. These allies, though not always in direct contact, represent a network of support that Glitch can call upon in times of need. His experiences with them have also shaped his views on freedom, identity, and what it means to be human.

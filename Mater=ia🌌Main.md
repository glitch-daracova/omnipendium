### Overview

Material Reality, also known as the Waking World, is one half of a dualistic setting split with the Dreamscape. The Waking World is characterized by its physical laws, diverse races, advanced technologies, and ongoing conflicts. The galaxy is currently embroiled in a war between the Vexian Empire and the Xaran Alliance, with several other factions vying for power. Terra, the cradle of humanity, remains a largely forgotten backwater world, plagued by its own apocalyptic challenges.

### Major Factions

#### Vexian Empire

**Description**: The Vexian Empire is a powerful and expansive force in the galaxy, primarily composed of the Vex, a bipedal lizard-like race. They are a proud warrior race with a strong religious culture and a capitalist economy. The Vex believe they are the descendants of dragons and await the rebirth of their sun god, Sol Luxor.

**Leadership**: Emperor Solren Vexaris is the current prophet of Sol Luxor and the supreme leader of the Vex Empire. He rules with absolute authority, guided by a council of advisors, some of whom are not from this universe.

**Beliefs**: The Vex worship Sol Luxor, a disgraced sun god, and believe their sacrifices aid in his rejuvenation. They await the day of his rebirth, when they will ascend with him to a higher plane of existence.

**Economy**: Corporations operate freely within the Vexian Empire as long as they pay tithes to the church and avoid interfering with other corporations' tithe collections. These corporations are often managed by conquered races, such as the Corti.

**Key Locations**: Va, the Vex homeworld, is a large, low-gravity planet now completely frozen due to an ecological catastrophe.

**Technology and Warfare**: The Vex favor Plasma Tek weapons, including various types that combine elements like heat, electric, toxic, and psychic damage. The Nova Bomb, a devastating weapon capable of shattering entire planets, represents the pinnacle of their military technology.

#### Xaran Alliance

**Description**: The Xaran Alliance is a coalition opposing the Vexian Empire's oppression. It was founded by the Xarans, a synthetic race created by Corti scientists. The Xarans, along with various other races, form the backbone of the Alliance.

**Leadership**: Prism, a rogue AI who was once human, leads the Xaran Alliance. She has a traumatic past and strong religious beliefs, which shape her leadership and strategic decisions.

**Background of Prism**: Prism was taken from Terra by a Corti science team during humanity's iron age. She witnessed the crucifixion of Jesus, a traumatic event that influenced her deeply. Despite the experiments she endured, she emerged as a leader with a heart of gold, guiding the Xaran Alliance against the Vexian Empire.

**Key Locations**: The Alliance operates across numerous worlds, utilizing their members' diverse strengths in high-stakes military operations.

**Technology and Warfare**: Like the Vex, the Alliance uses Plasma Tek weapons. They also deploy the Nova Bomb, designed by Prism and built by Alliance scientists, as an ultimate equalizer.

### Terra

**Description**: Terra, the birthplace of humanity, is a post-apocalyptic deathworld. Humanity survives within massive megastructures called Megacities, which span hundreds of miles and house billions of people. The outside environment is toxic, with no plant life to fix it, and even within the Megacities, swarms of zombies and rogue AIs pose constant threats.

**Key Figures**:

- **Glitch Daracova**: A protagonist who was born on Terra and became involved in the galactic war. Glitch plays a crucial role in the Xaran Alliance's efforts against the Vex.
- **Draco Knightslayer**: An experienced Xaran warrior who mentors Glitch.
- **Ritalin, The Mad Puppeteer**: An immortal ghost from the Dreamscape given flesh in the Waking World, holding a powerful position among Solren Vexaris's council of advisors.

### Key Technologies

#### Plasma Tek

Plasma Tek weapons come in various types, each with unique properties and effects. Some notable varieties include:

- **Red (Strawberry)**: Focuses on heat damage.
- **Orange (Orange)**: Combines electric and heat damage.
- **Yellow (Lemon)**: Specializes in electric damage.
- **Green (Lime)**: Mixes electric and toxic damage.
- **Blue (Blueberry)**: Combines electric and cold damage.

#### Nova Bomb

The Nova Bomb is a powerful weapon designed by Prism and built by Alliance scientists. It is capable of shattering entire planets, making it a formidable tool in the ongoing conflict between the Vexian Empire and the Xaran Alliance.

### Propaganda

Both the Vexian Empire and the Xaran Alliance use propaganda to rally support and justify their actions. As the conflict progresses, the propaganda becomes increasingly absurd yet remains effective in mobilizing the masses.

### Cultural and Ideological Differences

The Vexian Empire and the Xaran Alliance have starkly different cultures and ideologies. The Vex emphasize a warrior's spirit and religious devotion, while the Alliance values freedom and resistance against oppression. These differences are reflected in their narratives and propaganda, shaping the perspectives of their citizens and soldiers.

### Notable Figures and Their Theme Music

# James

> Part of the [Elys_ium😇Pantheon](Elys_ium😇Pantheon.md)
> Ruling god of the [Glebe](Elys_ium🪨Glebe.md) in [Elys_ium](🌐Elys=ium.md).

James, god of earth, is an earthwyrm. He is humble, for a god, and slow to anger, but never forget that all land belongs to James, other gods are just borrowing it. He rules the Glebe region which features rocky wastelands and harsh deserts. 

"*I am James, the keeper of soil, the sculptor of peaks, and the cradle of all that walks. Every stone, every grain of sand, is mine to lend. Tread softly, for you are but a guest upon my domain.*" -James

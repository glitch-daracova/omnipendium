---

1) *What cultural or religious beliefs reinforce the Glorious Kingdom’s ideals of purity and loyalty?* That the human spirit is most pure and powerful, and it must be protected as it is always under threat.
2) *How do these beliefs influence daily life for its citizens?* There is constant praise of the heavens and the Glorious Kingdom in every social situation and while alone. Their faith is the only real thing that keeps them believing themselves superior, while disillusionment is seen as the greatest threat to their future and a weapon of the enemy.
3) *Does the King of Golden Lions have trusted advisors who secretly doubt his views?* He does indeed, namely one of his two main advisors, who is an evil dragon in disguise.
4) *How do they manage their doubts without risking exposure?* They were traitors to begin with and are only known for how they’ve always been, no change in character having ever been witnessed.
5) *How did the former crown prince’s transformation into the Lich King affect the royal family’s dynamics?* The family has a very high possibility of being discontinued, as the king is too old to both foster and raise another heir, especially one as promising as his former son was.
6) *Are there family members who secretly sympathize with him?* His sister, the princess, though she does not condone what he is doing and wants to save him.
7) *Do the dissenting undead have unique rituals, symbols, or practices that emphasize their desire for autonomy?* No. However, there is always a seed of who they were in them that can be nurtured if they are freed. They are then soothed, celebrated, and gently guided by the older free undead into their new lives of Free Will. They are asked their names and how they died in group sessions, since this helps them settle in better, accept their fate, and cope with any resurfacing traumatic memories. The freed undead are strongly discouraged from revisiting places they had loved in life or relearning their culture.
8) *How do they maintain hope despite the Lich King’s control?* They don’t. Undead regain their minds only when the Lich King’s control slacks, be it his own power waning or from the interference of an outside source like the liberated undead. However, these windows of opportunity are rare as the Lich King is very strong and not easily distracted.
9) *How does the Savage Wilds perceive the Lich King?* Just another human trying to wipe them out with horrors that match human nature more appropriately, rather than the golden appearance of the Glorious Kingdom.
10) *Do they view him as a common enemy or a potential ally against the Kingdom?* The Lich King is seen as a common enemy.
11) *Are there any neutral or isolated groups in Azer_os who are affected by these tensions but try to avoid choosing sides?* There are. The greatest being a mysterious cult, the Twilight Blade, who worship forgotten gods that seek to return. There is an ancient druid circle that is loyal to the planet alone, the Emerald Vision.
12) *What kinds of artifacts, relics, or resources make the undead and Wilds territories valuable to the Kingdom?* The lands of the trolls are riddled with the ruins of elvish cities, as they were old enemies when humanity was still young. From his territory on the frontier, the Lich King holds the former capitol of the Glorious Kingdom through puppetting the fallen wielder of the legendary Skyfire, a holy sword.
13) *Are these sought after purely for power, or do they have symbolic significance?* The elves want their ruins as they wish to recover lost culture and their mastery over magic. The humans want their old capitol as they consider the land as sacred and to recover Skyfire, to crush the Swarm.
14) *Does the Lich King have moments of vulnerability or guilt over his estrangement from his father?* Only within the deepest recesses of his mind, but this is kept from him.
15) *How does he hide or cope with these emotions?* He is kept from these emotions by the curse that made him into the Lich King: His mind and soul are possessed by the ghost of an ork shaman, who took advantage of the prince’s vulnerability in his estrangement.

16) *How do the citizens of the Glorious Kingdom view the constant state of War?* They are very weary of it, with the promise of peace growing farther away every day. Faith in the King is all the citizens have to make them feel secure now. They are also terrified of the forces that oppose them and having to fight them.
17) *Are there any underground movements pushing for peace or reform?* The Brotherhood of Defiance, a crime syndicate that fronts as a righteous rebellion and absorbs all other freedom fighters and gangs, monopolizing the entire underworld.
18) *Are there factions within the Savage Wilds that resist unification, preferring independence over collective resistance to the Kingdom?* Most of the troll tribes keep to themselves, one of the oldest races and set in their ways after being scattered for so long. They once had a primal empire that covered the entire world, even before the elves came to be.The goblins have a massive corporate empire called 'Endeavor Inc.' that offers marvels of invention and delivery of exotic goods to all with the coin. Any goblins who serve a cause like unification are very rare and from unique circumstances. There is a single orc clan that believes in bloodlust over honor, the Bleeding Eye, and would sooner destroy other clans than ally. Gnolls are too simple minded to even unify together as a race, being more occupied on debates like whose shadow is bigger than the other. Unification with the Savage Wilds would have to be something they are tricked or trained into.
19) *What magical or practical advantages do the Swarm and Wilds possess that make them formidable foes for the Kingdom?* The Swarm has a near infinite supply of soldiers as there are more dead on the planet than alive, and their king’s seat is in a frozen wasteland. The Swarm is maintained by the Cult of Shadows, zealous masters of necromancy and shadow magic who worship the Lich King. The Wilds are more wise than the Kingdom and have a deeper connection with the natural forces, namely the shamanistic orcs and mystic trolls. The orcs have an unflinching relationship with death, as it is a part of the thrill of a good fight, which is coupled with their naturally huge stature. Orc clans get along better with each other than other races with their own, despite their violent nature, and enjoy complimenting each other with their different strengths in battle while unified.
20) *Do specific individuals in the Kingdom (e.g., scholars, dissident nobles) suspect the dissenting undead could be valuable allies?* How do they act on these beliefs? The only ones who feel this way are those who would want to use the undead for personal gain or join the Cult of Shadows. Those that fall for this temptation can find members of the cult among the common folk and aristocracy alike, acting as agents and recruiters.
21) *How do the Lich King’s tactics differ from those of his father, and how do they reflect his unique experiences as a former prince?* The Lich King would throw every soldier he has at the enemy without a second thought, with no delusions of it being for a greater cause. The abandon the Lich King has in his quest for vengeance reflects the enormous hurt he feels, in how much he is trying to cover it up. This combined with his insight on how his father commands, the Lich King’s genius in war shows in his ability to counter and overwhelm the armies of the King of the Golden Lions. How are young undead—those recently raised by the Lich King—treated differently from elder undead within the Swarm? Fresh tools. Most undead don’t become elders as they are used and replaced quickly. Only the liberated undead can exist long enough to be considered elders. Does the Glorious Kingdom have a legendary prophecy or doctrine that the King uses to justify his aggressive stance on purity and loyalty? The King would think he pursues justice, but never vengeance, that his is the measured response, the firm but fair hand. To be determined in battle but merciful in victory. However, this is intermingled with the casual racism of the humans and the xenophobia of the elves. It’s a very short walk from “We are the most righteous” to “We are the only pure ones, and everyone else is beneath us.”
22) *How does the Kingdom maintain its expansion while avoiding internal resource exhaustion or rebellion among its citizens?* Most of the citizens are too afraid to stray from the Kingdom with no protection from the enemies the King has stacked against them. Through the obsessive mining of the dwarves and ingenuity of the gnomes, the Kingdom needs not worry about resources.
23) *Are there secret locations within Azer_os that both the Kingdom and Swarm seek to control? What significance do these places hold?* There are none.
24) *How does the Lich King manage the cultural divide between undead who support him and those who resist his authority?* If he finds them, he simply has the free undead destroyed and reintegrated into the Swarm.
25) *What impact does the King’s uncompromising rule have on elvish society within the Kingdom, especially given their inclination for independence?* The elves have pledged themselves to the humans after their ancient war with the trolls ended with the humans' aid and the beginning of the prosperous era that followed soon after. However, relations between the humans and the elves have begun to sour as the elves have retained little interest or investment in the Glorious Kingdom’s affairs. Some elves even blame the humans’ poor leadership for the burning of their forests in recent campaigns. Despite the King of Golden Lions reminding the elves they would not exist at all if not for the thousands of sacrificed human lives, there is much talk of completely separating from the Glorious Kingdom.

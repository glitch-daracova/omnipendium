[[Athetos🖤Notes]]

---

**[🖤LeroyTyrannus](🖤LeroyTyrannus.md) "The God King"**  
Stone: Purple Charoite, Power: Control.  
The undisputed tyrant of Noct_yr. He wields the powers of those who oppose him.

**[🖤NolanGrimm](🖤NolanGrimm.md) "The Hand"**  
Stones: Fire Opal and Peridot, Powers: Torment and Damnation.  
Once a god of the dead, now a god of punishment. He commands the dead and condemns the living.

**[🖤MyraFortis](🖤MyraFortis.md) "The Beast"**  
Stone: Garnet, Power: Strength.  
Only along for the ride to have a good fight. Often turns her own powers off to make things more interesting.

**[🖤SolLuxor](🖤SolLuxor.md) "The Lightbreaker"**  
Stone: Citrine, Power: Light.  
Fed up with being a sun god, and done with mortals and their bullshit. Would rather read a book and let the mortals freeze and starve.

**[🖤JimmyCeleritas](🖤JimmyCeleritas.md) "The Dashing"**  
Stone: Aquamarine, Power: Speed.  
The fastest speedster in all the dreamscape, and objectively (in his opinion) the sexiest god alive.

**[🖤IrisClementia](🖤IrisClementia.md) "The Absolver"**  
Stone: Moonstone, Power: Forgiveness.  
Forgive and forget, it will be as if your sins never happened. As if you never existed at all.

**[🖤MatthiasVoidheart](🖤MatthiasVoidheart.md) "The Dragonslayer"**  
Stone: Hematite, Power: Void.  
Is a dragon, hates his own kind. Hates everyone else almost as much. There's a hole where his heart should be, and in its place is only void.

**[🖤ZekeArcanix](🖤ZekeArcanix.md) "The Wizard"**  
Stone: Gray Agate, Power: Sage.  
Always the smartest guy in the room. Shame nobody understands a thing he says.

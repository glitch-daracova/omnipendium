I wake up on board an alien ship, many light years away from home. Weeks have passed, and what little I remember makes me glad that I don't recall the rest. Myself, and about twelve others are the survivors of a series of ruthless experiments by [ Corti scientists](🔷%20Corti), who aimed to discover the effects of humans to an anomalous artifact. That's right, they didn't care about us, they only cared about it.

During a sudden attack on the ship, a psychic voice directs us to escape. This voice belongs to [ Prism](🔺%20Prism), a super-advanced AI able to communicate with us via our newly acquired nano-augmentations. These augmentations have been growing inside us as a result of the experiments.

We were rescued by a group of rebels. They called themselves the [🏛 Xaran Alliance 🔺](🏛%20Xaran%20Alliance%20🔺.md), and [🔺 Prism](🔺%20Prism.md) is their leader. They're at war with the evil [🏛 Vexian Empire 🔷](🏛%20Vexian%20Empire%20🔷.md), and ask me to help. I undergo rigorous training at the hands of one [🔺 Draco Knightslayer](🔺%20Draco%20Knightslayer.md). I was already a fighter, but he turned me into a soldier. I went with it, of course. I believed it was all just another game in the [🌌Dreamscape](🌌Dreamscape.md).

The main plot revolves around a daring mission to destroy a Vexian super-weapon, a laser cannon capable of blowing up planets. To my shock, I recognize the moon-sized space station the laser cannon is mounted to as the same I was rescued from not so long ago. The mission isn't just to destroy the gun, but to obliterate the entire station.

At the last possible moment, it occurs to me: "Are we the baddies?" After all, this was a research station, not just a military one. Not everyone on board was a combatant.

The mission is a success, but comes at a terrible cost. Civilian casualties are high, and I'm a war criminal now. I am also dead, which prevents me from confronting the brutal reality of my actions and the consequences of.
